# Tiny Rituals Variant Feature Development Theme

> Tiny Rituals Variant Feature Development Theme is actively in development and it requires attention.

Tiny Rituals Variant Feature Development Theme is for the store [TinyRituals.co](https://tinyrituals.co) and it has specific feature that needs to be implemented.

> Scope: Specifically, reproduce the EXACT FUNCTIONALITY OF SOZY, backend and frontend. Specifically:
Back End Experience:
To select a specific product for a variant, the alt text would need to match just like on Sozyâ€™s site.
Front End Experience:
When users select a different variant (size/color combinations) the images change on the PDP (product detail page)
Potential Blockers: Maybe will need to add variant images and alt text to the products. Need a test SKU.

## Development requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with `Tiny Rituals Variant Feature Development` theme:

- **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- **NPM 5+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have [ups and downs](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/), choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions [for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to make sure you're using the latest version.

- **ThemeKit:** Themekit should be installed for development in local. [ThemeKit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/).

- **config.yml:** `config.yml` file is required for the development in local. [config.yml](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/configuration/).
